  In binary shift operations `x<<n` and `x>>n`, the n operand determines the number of bit positions to shift and must be unsinged; the x operand may be signed or unsigned .Arithmetically the left shift `x<<n` is equivalent to multiplication by 2<sup>n</sup> and right shift ``x>>n` is equivalent to the floor of division by 2<sup>n</sup>.
