## Packages

We write all the code in packages, upto now, we been writing the codes in main packages.  
The main Package is the entry point for the program execution, so probably for huge project we dont want to write there.  
Talking about Packages, there are loads of built in packages in Go. The only packages we have been using for this tutorial is only `fmt` package.
